# Booth's Algorithm Implementation 🔢

This repository contains a simple C++ implementation of **Booth's Algorithm** — an efficient algorithm for multiplying two signed binary numbers in 2's complement form.

## 🧠 What is Booth's Algorithm?

Booth's Algorithm is used for **binary multiplication** of signed integers. It's faster than traditional multiplication because it **reduces the number of addition operations** based on bit patterns.
